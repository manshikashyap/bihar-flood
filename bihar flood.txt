FLOOD IN BIHAR
Floods are probably the most recurring ,widespread,disasterous and frequnent natural hazards of the world. Bihar is India's most flood prone state ,with 76% population in the 
north bihar living under the recurring threat of flood devastations. on the annual basis theory flood destroy thousands of human lives apart from livestock and assets
worth millions.North bihar districts are vulnerable to atleast five major flood causing rivers during monsoon.

when heavy rains occur in the mountains of central and the eastern nepal the water flows into the major drainages. as these rivers criss into india they flow into the plains and 
low lands of bihar and break their banks. to protect the koshi river dam asa well as the koshi barrage pool's embankments, Indian engineers who are in charge of the dam in nepal, further 
opens the dam's gate which can cause flooding down river in bihar.
Due to the recurrent floods in Bihar millions of people have been migrated from that area to the urban area even outside the state in the search of work. Food security that is
 gets severely affected. Further, due to reduced productivity, food prices rises resulting in inflation. Reduced purchasing capacity of common man bring decline in demands of 
other products and because of demand and supply rule, the industries get affected.This partially or completely shut downs the economic activities like industries, business
 establishments causing reduced production followed by adverse impact on economic growth.Further, after floods, high cost of relief and recovery may adversely impact the 
investment in infrastructure and other development activities in the area. Keeping this in mind, there is a need to minimize negative consequences and ill effects of flooding
 by means of flood management.
